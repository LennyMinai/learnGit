This is a beginner-friendly tutorial-based project where I learnt about Git, Git bash and Github.

Key takeaways on "How to clone repo from Github":
1. Learn the basic console commands and the Linux commands ( I will create a separate branch about this soon). 
2. Login to your Github Account (If you don't have one, create one from "github.com/join" ).
3. Create a repository in Github ( Choose any name).
4. Install Git on your local machine.
5. Clone the repository from github to your local git using "git clone" and "git pull".
6. Set credentials for github and make the required changes to your repository.
7. Update and push the local repository to github.

N/B:
There are two main ways to start working with git:
1. Initializing on your local machine using "git init" which adds ".git (hidden)" folder.
2. Cloning repo from Github (Which is the method that I have used for this case).

Method two is the most preferred due to simplicity.
